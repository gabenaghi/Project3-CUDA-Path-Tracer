## Overview

In addition to the challenging content of this course, I am faced with the additional disadvantage of lacking a background in computer graphics. While I am more than happy to learn the topic as needed, my lack of experince sometimes comes to a head, as it did during this project. To me, this proejct was a swirl of confusing instructions, starter code, and concept all packaged up in an environment in which debugging tools are severly lacking. 

### Basic Path Tracer

For the basic path tracer, we were asked to implement a BSDF material shader and add stream compaction to optimize the ray tracer performace.
